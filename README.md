# Entity Component System

It's a demo project to experiment the ECS pattern in  web develpment.

demo: https://gitawego.github.io/ecsjs/
## note for ECS

- add `storageComponent` for an entity which should be stored in database
- `removeSystem` should be called at last in order to clean up the resources before removing the entity
